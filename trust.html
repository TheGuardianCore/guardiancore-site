    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        These principles apply to all Guardian Core engagements and communications, including assessments,
        advisory work, documentation, and security-related support activities.

    <section>
      <h2>Operating Principles</h2>
      <p>
        Guardian Core aligns its operating principles with the CIA triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—
        which is widely used within the information security profession to guide risk management and control design.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        Protect information against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to information is limited to the minimum necessary to achieve agreed objectives.</li>
        <li>Sensitive information is shared only with authorized stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Secure communication and transfer methods are used where appropriate.</li>
        <li>Client information is treated as confidential unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        Preserve the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of systems, data, and security decisions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Findings and recommendations are evidence-based and documented.</li>
        <li>Assumptions, constraints, and limitations are stated transparently.</li>
        <li>Recommendations are designed to reduce risk without introducing hidden fragility.</li>
        <li>Deliverables are prepared to support governance review and audit scrutiny.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Availability</h2>
      <p>
        Support the reliability and accessibility of systems and services for legitimate business needs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security recommendations consider resilience, continuity, and recoverability.</li>
        <li>Controls are designed to reduce single points of failure where practical.</li>
        <li>Usability and operational impact are considered to reduce unsafe workarounds.</li>
        <li>Security is positioned as an operational enabler, not an obstacle.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Authorization &amp; Engagement Boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        Guardian Core performs security activities only within explicitly defined and authorized scope.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No testing, validation, or assessment is performed without documented authorization.</li>
        <li>All activities are limited to the systems, environments, and objectives agreed in advance.</li>
        <li>No attempt is made to access systems, data, or accounts outside the authorized scope.</li>
        <li>Any requested change to scope requires explicit agreement prior to execution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Where testing is requested, the method, timing, and constraints are defined in advance to reduce operational risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Professional Conduct</h2>
      <p>
