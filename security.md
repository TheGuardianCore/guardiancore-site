# Security Policy

Guardian Core takes the security of our public website and repositories seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly so we can investigate and remediate it.

---

## Supported Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The Guardian Core public website content hosted via GitHub Pages for this repository
- Repository configuration and files that are directly part of the site (HTML/CSS/assets)

Out of scope:

- Third-party services and infrastructure not controlled by Guardian Core (e.g., GitHub platform vulnerabilities, ISP/DNS provider issues beyond our configuration, vendor services)
- Social engineering, phishing attempts, physical attacks, or threats against individuals
- Denial-of-service (DoS) testing or traffic flooding
- Automated scanning that degrades availability

If you’re unsure whether something is in scope, report it anyway and we’ll confirm.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

Please send a report with details to:

- **Email:** zhudson@guardiancore.ca
- **Subject line:** SECURITY: Vulnerability Report - guardiancore-site

If you do not have an email available yet, you can open a GitHub Issue **only if** the information is not sensitive.  
For sensitive details, please avoid public disclosure and use email.

## What to Include

To help us triage quickly, include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and affected page(s) or file(s)
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept is helpful)
- Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
- Screenshots or logs (if relevant)
- Your environment details (browser/OS, request/response details if applicable)
- Whether the issue is still reproducible

---

## Safe Testing Guidelines

Please do:

- Use the least invasive method possible
- Limit testing to your own accounts and devices
- Stop testing immediately once you can demonstrate impact

Please do not:

- Exfiltrate data (even if accessible)
- Modify or delete content
- Attempt to access accounts, GitHub settings, or infrastructure you do not own
- Run mass scanners or brute force tests

---

## Response Targets

We aim to:

- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**
- Provide a status update within **10 business days**
- Remediate confirmed issues as quickly as reasonably possible based on severity and risk

Timelines may vary depending on complexity and dependencies.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We support coordinated disclosure and appreciate a reasonable time window to investigate and fix issues before any public discussion.

If you would like public credit, you may request it in your report.
